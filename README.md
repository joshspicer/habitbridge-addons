## Sensors Created

The addon creates the following entities in Home Assistant:

- `sensor.habitbridge_[habit_name]` - For each habit, shows "completed" or "not_completed"
- `sensor.habitbridge_completion_rate` - Percentage of habits completed today
- `sensor.habitbridge_all_completed` - "on" when all habits are completed, "off" otherwise

## Example Automations

### LED Strip Example

This example turns an LED strip green when all habits are completed for the day, and red otherwise.

```yaml
# Example automation for RGB LED strip
automation:
  - alias: "HabitBridge - Update LED Based on Habit Completion"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: sensor.habitbridge_all_completed
    action:
      - service: >
          {% if trigger.to_state.state == "on" %}
          light.turn_on
          {% else %}
          light.turn_on
          {% endif %}
        target:
          entity_id: light.led_strip
        data:
          {% if trigger.to_state.state == "on" %}
          rgb_color: [0, 255, 0]  # Green
          {% else %}
          rgb_color: [255, 0, 0]  # Red
          {% endif %}
```

### Daily Habit Reminder

```yaml
# Reminder if habits not completed by evening
automation:
  - alias: "HabitBridge - Evening Reminder"
    trigger:
      - platform: time
        at: "20:00:00"
    condition:
      - condition: state
        entity_id: sensor.habitbridge_all_completed
        state: "off"
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          message: "Don't forget to complete your habits for today!"
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Not receiving webhook data?** Make sure:
  - The addon is running
  - Your Home Assistant instance is accessible from your phone
  - The webhook URL is correct in the HabitBridge app
  - Check the addon logs for more information

### Testing the Webhook

You can use the included test script to send sample data to your webhook without needing the HabitBridge app:

```bash
# SSH into your Home Assistant instance or use the Terminal & SSH addon
cd /addons/habitbridge
python3 test_webhook.py http://localhost:8000/webhook
```

This will send sample habit data to your webhook endpoint and show the response, which is useful for verifying that the addon is working correctly.
